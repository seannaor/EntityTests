* Discuss ON DELETE CASCADE
* tagging_stages create: maybe redundant: FOREIGN KEY (`appropriate_coding_stage_index`, `experiment_id`) REFERENCES code_stages (`stage_index`, `experiment_id`)
* ERD: add relation between tagging stage and requirement tags
* ERD: fix relation between experiments and grading task
* Participants: consider inheritance ("is a" relationship)
* ERD: PARTICIPANTS --- n --- <> --- 0...1 --- GRADERS
* GradingTask: forgot about the concensus, HAVE TO REVIEW
* Maybe mediator between controllers
* maybe replace Set collection with List (no access)


SHAHAR IS ASKING:
CodeStage should have a list of Requirement
Question should have field - text (the question itself)
